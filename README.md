Rock, Paper, Scissors, Secret Fourth Thing

This is a game I created one weekend during my software bootcamp after we started learning JavaScript. I wanted to experiment with how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interacted with each other. I wanted to create a look similar to the old school choose-your-own-adventure text games for the main part of the project. It starts out as a standard rock, paper, scissors game, where the player makes a choice and the computer randomly generates a choice. After a bit, a secret fourth choice button appears, where the computer randomly chooses an option for the player from an array of random objects/possibilities. One of those choices prompts the program to go in a totally different direction altogehter. Eventually, the game gets truly ugly but mostly on purpose, because rendering elements on top of each other with no consideration for style/aesthetics was cracking me up. The project is currently incomplete and in need of refactoring.

This project was created in VSC using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
